    "Simple ratios are easier to understand. Your brain is able to recognize it clearly and is able to predict it. More complex ratios are harder to read by the brain, because it they are harder to predict (it takes more compute power to tell the individual signals apart). A complicated 11/8 jazz drum pattern is much harder to predict to the average person than the simple 4/4 of a hit pop song.\n",

Another thing that is made of frequency is pitch, or the notes you would hear from a guiter strings.

That means that if we could play a drum incredibly fast, 440 times a second, we could play an A major. \n",
