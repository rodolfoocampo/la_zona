On a quest to create personalized computer generated music

What makes sounds pleasant? What are the patterns underlying music aesthetics? 
Why do some musical structures help you concentrate better?
Can we program them? Can we learn them? This is a journey to tackle those questions and here I will share my process.

My medium term goal is creating a simple service to stream personalized generative beats and ambient music 
to help people focus better in whatever they choose to work on. 

In essence, I want to write code to manipulate air vibrations that help humans get in *la zona*
